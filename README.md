Separately, we each took 300 photos of ourselves. However, our images are too similar because our network has 100% accuracy on the test data. For our next solution we will be updating our datasets to include more different photos. 

We met several times to write the facial cropping cell, the dataset/ dataloader cell and to train/ evaluate and troubleshoot the CNN. All code was done together while meeting.
